# Config Installation
The following describes how to bootstrap this config onto a fresh system.
Since the config uses the `oh-my-zsh` shell framework, much of the instructions
are taken and adapted from the `oh-my-zsh` [docs](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki) and [README](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/README.md).
## Prerequisites:
- A Unix-like operating system
- `curl` or `wget` installed
- `git` installed
## 1. Copy Files
- Copy all files in this repository into root directory, replacing any existing files.

## 1.5 Configure iTerm2 (if Desired)
In `Preferences > General > Preferences` select the box to load from `~/.iterm`. Select save settings if desired.

## 2. Install and Set Up zsh
### In General
1. Install zsh and make it default shell using a method below.
2. Log out and login back again to use your new default shell.
3. Test that it worked with `echo $SHELL`. Expected result: `/bin/zsh` or similar.
4. Test with `$SHELL --version`. Expected result: 'zsh 5.4.2' or similar

### Notes:
- Setting the default shell is done byb executing
`chsh -s $(which zsh)`, which will not work if Zsh is not in your authorized shells list (`/etc/shells`)
    or if you don't have permission to use `chsh`. If that's the case [you'll need to use a different procedure](https://www.google.com/search?q=zsh+default+without+chsh).

### macOS
**Try `zsh --version` before installing it from Homebrew. If it's newer than 4.3.9
you _might_ be OK. Preferably newer than or equal to `5.0`.**

```sh
brew install zsh
```
To set zsh as your default shell, execute the following for **macOS High Sierra**
```
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```
Assuming you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed. If not, most versions of
**macOS** ship zsh by default, but it's normally an older version.

```sh
sudo port install zsh zsh-completions
```

## 3. Install Oh My Zsh
`oh-my-zsh` provides an automated install script at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh

To install, this script should be run

### via curl

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL <script_url>)"
```

### or via wget

```shell
sh -c "$(wget -O- <script_url>)"
```

## 4. Install Fonts (GUI Client Machine)
(From [powerlevel10k docs](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/README.md))

Download these four ttf files:

- [MesloLGS NF Regular.ttf](
    https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf)
- [MesloLGS NF Bold.ttf](
    https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold.ttf)
- [MesloLGS NF Italic.ttf](
    https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Italic.ttf)
- [MesloLGS NF Bold Italic.ttf](
    https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold%20Italic.ttf)

double-click to install them. Make sure `MesloLGS NF` is available in font-manager and set the font for any desired applications (Terminal, VSCode, etc). The downloaded files can now be deleted.

Note: the VSCode `settings` entry for the terminal font is `terminal.integrated.fontFamily`.

## 5. Install Powerlevel10k
- Download and install:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```
- Restart `zsh` shell.

This will probably trigger a setup wizard, but you should be able to keep the existing `.p10k` config file should you desire.
